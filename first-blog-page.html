            <h2>my first exposure</h2>
            <p>My journey to Web Development started in my 5th semester of college where I opted for Web Technology as my Department Elective. Initially, I was under the idea that I'll just be learning about Web Technloogies and not the actual Web Development languages and to be honest, I hardly paid any attention in the class. Fast forward a few weeks and we were assigned with a project to be ready by the next month. We were instructed to make use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and at that point of time, I had 0 clue about these languages.</p>

            <h2>and the learning began...</h2>
            <p>I arranged for a Codecademy premium subscription with the help of a friend of mine, and without thinking twice, considering the deadline I was facing, I took up the full stack web development course. I started with HTML and CSS, and took a pause there since I then had to start working my on website. I thought of creating my portfolio website, a basic one, since I didn't have a lot of time. Just when I was about to start working on it, I came across a Canadian person's profile who happened to be a full stack developer since the past 5-6 years. I visited his portfolio website and I thought that maybe I could create something similar. Then came to my rescue, inspect element, I looked up his code, googled and understood all the CSS properties he used, and tried to use them for my website. I understood how he created the outlay for his website and then I implemented the same thing in my website.</p>
